# Phonebook App

A simple React application for storing contacts in a phonebook. Users can add, filter, and delete contacts, with data persisted in local storage. The app also demonstrates how to use Formik and Yup for form handling and validation, as well as how to implement a full-screen background video and styling with CSS Modules.

## Features
  Add New Contacts: Use a Formik-powered form with Yup validation (required fields, minimum/maximum length).
  Filter Contacts: Search for contacts by name in real-time (case-insensitive).
  Delete Contacts: Remove any existing contact with a single click.
  Local Storage Persistence: Contacts remain available after page refresh or browser restart.
  Background Video: A looping MP4 video displayed as a fullscreen background.
  Styling with CSS Modules: Each component has its own CSS module, keeping styles modular and maintainable.
  Responsive & Centered Design: The main content is centered both vertically and horizontally, ensuring a clean UI across various screen sizes.
